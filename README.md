Pizza restaurant

Specifications

Piccadilly wants its system to:

- [ ] Track all of its customers and any relevant customer information, such as customer ID, name, username/login details, delivery address(es), phone number(s), payment methods on file (e.g., cash, credit, check - if credit, then the card number should also be stored), etc.
- [ ] Track the ingredients that comprise each of these preferences (e.g., onions, ham, pineapple, anchovies, bacon, etc.)
- [ ] Support an interface for each of its delivery drivers, tracking the addresses each driver delivers to, the dates/times of delivery, and money collected (including tips)

- [ ] Track its pizza sizes (small, medium, large, extra large), types (thick or thin crust), ingredients (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, cheese, etc.), price data for these pizza sizes and ingredients.
- [ ] Maintain a history of transactions - all purchases including price, payment method, and delivery date.
 
 
 ## Stretch Goals
 
 - [ ] Track standard drinks, including a product ID, drink description, manufacturer, supplier, price
 - [ ] Support calculating the proper sales tax (the pizza joint located at the intersection of the four corners of the US, so you might have to support sales taxes for Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah)
 


HINT: if you see an item in bold, you may want to consider creating a table for that item. :)
